Notwithstanding the foregoing, HotSchedules reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to modify these Terms or the policies referenced herein at any time as set forth above.<br><br> 
	
	20.3.	Governing Law, Jurisdiction and Venue. These Terms shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the state of Delaware, without reference to its choice of law rules. Subject to the arbitration provisions below, exclusive venue for any action arising out of or in connection with this agreement shall be in Wilmington, Delaware. The parties each hereby consent to the jurisdiction and venue in Wilmington, Delaware and waive any objections to such jurisdiction and venue. Notwithstanding the foregoing, you agree that HotSchedules shall be entitled to apply for injunctive remedies or other equitable relief in any jurisdiction.<br><br>
	
	20.4.	Dispute Resolution.  Excluding claims for injunctive or other equitable relief, for any claim where the total amount of the award sought is less than $10,000, the party requesting relief may elect to resolve the dispute through binding non-appearance-based arbitration. In the event a party elects arbitration, they shall initiate such arbitration through an established alternative dispute resolution provider mutually agreed upon by the parties. The arbitration shall be conducted by telephone, online or be solely based on written submissions; the specific manner shall be chosen by the party initiating the arbitration. The arbitration shall not require any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless otherwise mutually agreed by the parties. Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator shall be final and may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. You agree that any dispute resolution proceedings will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated or representative action. If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration each party waives any right to a jury trial.<br><br>
	
	20.5	Limited Time to Bring Claim. Subject to any applicable law to the contrary, you agree that any cause of action arising out of or related to the use of our Site or Services must be commenced within one (1) year after the cause of action accrues, or such action will be permanently barred.<br><br> 
	
	20.6.	Severability. If any portion of these Terms is found to be unenforceable or invalid for any reason, that provision will be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that the rest of these Terms will otherwise remain in full force and effect.<br><br> 
	
	20.7.	Assignment. You may not assign your rights or obligations under these Terms without the prior written consent of HotSchedules, which may be withheld in HotSchedules' sole discretion.<br><br> 
	
	20.8.	Non-Waiver. HotSchedules' failure to insist upon or enforce any provision of these Terms shall not be construed as a waiver of any provision or right.<br><br>
	
	20.9.	Survival.  Any sections or terms which by their nature should survive or are otherwise necessary to enforce the purpose of these Terms, will survive the termination of these Terms and termination of the Services.<br><br>
	
	20.10.	Headings.  All headings included in these Terms are included for convenience only, and shall not be considered in interpreting these Terms.<br><br>
	
	20.11.	HotSchedules' Rights Cumulative.  These Terms do not limit any rights that HotSchedules may have pursuant to any intellectual property laws or any other laws. All rights and remedies available to HotSchedules, pursuant to this Agreement or otherwise, at law or in equity, are cumulative and not exclusive of any other rights or remedies that may be available to HotSchedules.<br><br>
	
	20.12	No Injunctive Relief.  In no event shall you seek or be entitled to rescission, injunctive or other equitable relief, or to enjoin or restrain the operation of the Site or Services, or any other materials issued in connection therewith, or exploitation of the Services or any content or other material used or displayed through the Services.<br><br>
	
	20.13	Notice.  If you have any questions, complaints, or claims, you may contact HotSchedules at: 6504 Bridge Point Parkway, Suite 425, Austin TX 78730, <b>(512) 904-4299</b>.<br><br>
